            <br>
            I wanted to create a scene that gave a humble deer lying on the grass and aura of power and strength. Being a herbivore, deer’s are not a naturally aggressive but if provoked they will use their antlers to attack. Therefore, I wanted to emphasis the stored energy and power that is contained within these antlers. 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Steps to create image:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1.</strong>	Using the selection tool, I selected the deer and I refined the edges using the Select & Mask tool.
                <br>
                <strong>2.</strong>	I created a layer mask and used the Polygonal Lasso tool to cut out the antlers.
                <br>
                <strong>3.</strong>	Using (Ctrl+J), I duplicated a new layer for the antlers.
                <br>
                <strong>4.</strong>	I added a “Moonlight.3DL” filter to the original background using the Colour Lookup tool on the layer and changed the opacity to the desired effect. 
                <br>
                <strong>5.</strong>	I created a new group using (Ctrl+G) and added the antlers layer and converted the layer to a smart object.
                <br>
                <strong>6.</strong>	I duplicated the layer again and changed the blending mode to linear dodge.
                <br>
                <strong>7.</strong>	I then used the Gaussian Blue filter and set the radius to 5 to create the glow effect.
                <br>
                <strong>8.</strong>	I repeated step 7 a few more time by duplicating each layer and increasing the radius settings.
                <br>
                <strong>9.</strong>	To create the glow effect, I added an Hue/Saturation adjustment layer to the group and applied a clipping mask. I checked colourise in the settings and adjusted the Hue and Saturation to the desired effect.
                <br>
                <strong>10.</strong> I added Curves adjustment layer to change help emphasis the contrast between light and dark.
                <br>
                <strong>11.</strong> Using the brush tool and setting the colour to black, I painted the highlighted areas on the body of the deer and then Duplicated the Hue/Saturation layer in Step 9. I dragged the duplicated layer over the top of the curves and applied a clipping mask.
                <br>
                <strong>12.</strong> Using (Ctrl+I), inverted the mask and using the paint brush tool and setting the colour to white, I began to paint on the highlights.
                <br>
                <strong>13.</strong> I added sparkle to the antlers by adding an image of stars over the image and changing the blending mode of the layer to “screen”. I then added a mask to the later and using (Ctrl+I), I inverted the mask and painted the stars in using the paintbrush and setting the colour to white.
                <br>
                <strong>14.</strong> I then saved the images as a PNG as the compression is lossless and it can be reedited in necessary without losing quality.

        <p><strong>Colour</strong><br>
        <br>
        Whilst researching for my GCSE history coursework, I came across an interesting fact about the Statue of Liberty. The Statue was a gift of friendship to United States of America from the people of France. It symbolised “Liberty Enlightening the World” and was made from copper. When the statue first arrived to Staten Island in 1886, it had a shiny copper colour but as time has passed, it has discoloured due to oxidation, high winds and air pollution. For this image, I wanted to use photoshop to restore the original colour to the statue and then create Time Magazine style cover to symbolise the renewed hope of the American people through the restoration of the statue and the election of President Joe Biden.
        </p>
        <p class="directions">
            Steps to create image:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1.</strong>	Using the quick selection tool, I selected the whole statue (including the base).
            <br>
            <strong>2.</strong>	To change the colour, I used the Hue/Saturation tool and created an adjustment layer that clipped it to the selection.
            <br>
            <strong>3.</strong>		When the desirable colour was reached, I created a new layer with the changes by using the shortcut (Command+Option+Shift+e).
            <br>
            <strong>4.</strong>		I created a new photoshop file that was 2550px x 3300px (The same size as a Time Magazine cover).
            <br>
            <strong>5.</strong>		I added the layer and using the rectangle tool, I added two borders to the image to create the iconic Time Magazine style look. 
            <br>
            <strong>6.</strong>		I added the Time Magazine logo by creating a text box and using “Times New Roman” Font at 170pt. 
            <br>
            <strong>7.</strong>		I created a layer mask and using the brush tool, I painted around the torch to stop the text from covering the flame.
            <br>
            <strong>8.</strong>		I downloaded a font called “RNS Sanz” to create the article headline texts on the image.
            <br>
            <strong>9.</strong>		I then saved the images as a PNG as the compression is lossless and it can be reedited in necessary without losing quality.

        <p><strong>Double Exposure</strong><br>
            <br>
            As an architect, it has always been my ambition to see the Empire State Building in real life. So, in 2018, I decided to go and visit the big apple for the first time. It was genuinely a lifechanging trip for me but I wanted to demonstrate how much the all the ideas and visions that I experienced on my trip had influence my mind. Therefore, I used an image of me on a Hudson River Ferry tour and added a backdrop of a typical scene of a New York street to show my own take on a “NY State of Mind”.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Steps to create image:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1.</strong>	Using the crop tool, I cropped the original image of myself and used the Quick Selection tool with Select and Mask to remove the background.
                <br>
                <strong>2.</strong>	I created a background layer and added a light background colour of #fdfdfd.
                <br>
                <strong>3.</strong>	I used the layer adjustment  and a clipping mask to create a Channel Mixer and applied the monochrome button to turn the image from colour to black and white.               
                <br>
                <strong>4.</strong>	I added the curves layer adjustment to increase the contrast.
                <br>
                <strong>5.</strong>	I then opened the image of NY city in a separate Photoshop file and added a Black and White adjustment layer. I decreased the levels of Blues, Magentas and increased the level of Cyan to make the image lighter in the shadows and darker in the sunlight areas.  
                <br>
                <strong>6.</strong>	In order to blend the image of NY city with my head, I made the sky lighter by using the Lasso Tool to select the sky and using (Select>Modify>Feather) and setting the value to 550px. I added a levels layer adjustment to brighten up the sky. 
                <br>
                <strong>7.</strong>	Using (Shift+Option+Alt+E), I merged the layers together into a new layer and dragged this into the photoshop file with my face.
                <br>
                <strong>8.</strong>	I moved the image of NY City into position, with the street running through the middle of my head and once I was happy with the position I changed the Blend Mode of the layer to “Multiply”.
                <br>
                <strong>9.</strong>	I dragged the clipping mask of my face using (Select+Option) to the layer with the buildings.
                <br>
                <strong>10.</strong> Using the brush tool and setting the colour to Black, I painted away the areas of my face that were blocking the NY Skyline.
                <br>
                <strong>11.</strong> Using the same brush tool, I set the colour to white but I applied it onto the mask of NY City to add the details of my face back in. 
                <br>
                <strong>12.</strong> I then saved the images as a PNG.

            <br>
            I wanted to create an impossible image that could really show the ability of how photoshop can be used to make our dreams into reality. One of my earliest dreams was of a whale swimming through the open sky. The image uses 3 separate images to illustrate a whale leaping out of clouds and spraying stars across the sky.
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Steps to create image:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1.</strong>	I opened up a new photoshop file and set the dimensions to 4500px x 3000px. I then added the image of the clouds and using (Ctrl+T), I reflected the images and cropped to an area of cloud that I wanted.
                <br>
                <strong>2.</strong>	Using the Quick Selection tool, I separated the foreground clouds from the back ground clouds and refined the selection using Select and Mask. I duplicated the layer using (Ctrl+J) and deleted the layer mask from the background image.
                <br>
                <strong>3.</strong>	I created a misty effect between the two clouds by using the paintbrush tool and changing the opacity and brush shape. I used the eyedropper to select the lightest colour for the mist and changed the Belding Mode to “Screen”.              
                <br>
                <strong>4.</strong>	I added the image of the Whale and using the Select and Mask tool, I deleted the background and rotated the image using (Ctrl+T) to make the Whale appear to be leaping out of the clouds.
                <br>
                <strong>5.</strong>	I created a layer mask for the Whale layer and used Hue/Saturation to adjust both the shadow areas and the light areas on the Whale.
                <br>
                <strong>6.</strong>	I then added a Photo Filter to and clipped it to the Whale layer and set the colour to the same orange as the cloud highlight to blend the image.
                <br>
                <strong>7.</strong>	I added the image of the styles over the background layer and set the Blending Mode to “Screen” in order to give the illusion that the Whale was splashing stars.
                <br>
                <strong>8.</strong> I then saved the images as a PNG and kept the dimensions so it could be used as a high resolution desktop background.

            What if one day, our phones had hologram technology that would allow us to see images in 3D. I have seen this technology demonstrated on Sci-Fi movies before but I wanted to express my vision for how holographic LCD technology would look like on a typical iPhone screen. I chose the image of a Leopard leaping out of a tree on a sunny African day onto the arms of a iPhone user on a typical rainy British day to show the capabilities of what this technology would allow us to feel and experience.

                Steps to create image:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1.</strong>	I started by opening a new photoshop file and adding the background image of the iPhone.
                <br>
                <strong>2.</strong>	I then overlaid the image of the leopard and adjusted the size and position by using the free transform tool (Ctrl+T).
                <br>
                <strong>3.</strong>	Using the Pen tool, I drew around the edge of the iPhone screen and the Leopard’s body.            
                <br>
                <strong>4.</strong>	Using a Hue/Saturation Layer Adjustment, I increased the contrast on the image of the Leopard to emphasis the glow.
                <br>
                <strong>5.</strong>	To create the glow of the screen, I used the pen tool to draw the around the phone and the persons hands and then drew diagonal lines to extend out of the image. 
                <br>
                <strong>6.</strong>	I added a gradient filter and used the “Gaussian Blur” effect to emphasis the glow.
                <br>
                <strong>7.</strong>	I then took a screenshot from my iPhone and in Adobe Illustrator, I turned the iPhone graphics into a vector file and dragged them into the photoshop image as smart objects. 
                <br>
                <strong>8.</strong>	I placed the objects relative to the glow effect to give the holographic appearance of the iPhone screen.
                <br>

        <p><strong>Mirroring</strong><br>
            <br>
            For this image, I wanted to create a scene that would directly come out of a Sci-Fi movie. I chose and image of a rocket testing launch in the Nevada desert and using photoshop, I added a geometric shape that would almost appear as a floating UFO. The dynamic of the image had completely changed. What seemed like a fun day out in the desert, suddenly became potentially shocking encounter with an unexplained floating object. The use of the mirroring technique and the clone stamp tool, perfectly captures what image manipulation can achieve. 
            </p>
            <p class="directions">
                Steps to create image:
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>1.</strong>	The first step was to remove the rocket and the smoke and this was done by using the Clone Stamp tool in Photoshop.
                <br>
                <strong>2.</strong>	I then created the geometric shape using the pen tool.
                <br>
                <strong>3.</strong>	I created a separate layer for each side of the shape by using the Path tool and saving each path to a new layer.      
                <br>
                <strong>4.</strong>	I duplicated the background layer (Ctrl+J), and moved the layer above the side of the geometric shape and clipped it to the layer.
                <br>
                <strong>5.</strong>	Using the free Transform tool (Ctrl+T), I reshaped, reflected and rotated each image to give the desired mirror effect.
                <br>
                <strong>6.</strong>	I grouped each layer and shape together and added an inner glow effect.
                <br>
                <strong>7.</strong>	Using the Paint Brush tool and setting the colour to Black and 30% opacity , I painted in dark areas around each shape to give shadows. 
                <br>
                <strong>8.</strong>	I repeated steps 4-7 for each side of the shape until I was happy that the mirroring effect had been achieved.
                <br>
                <strong>9.</strong> I then saved the images as a PNG as the compression is lossless and it can be reedited in necessary without losing quality.

        <h1>Animated Gif</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Kingdom Interiors</h3>
        <p>
            The idea for the mock-ups and the animated GIF came from my plan to start an interior design company. I designed a logo for the brand and I had already established a set of UI Style guides. My own style of design can be considered as minimalist and I wanted the branding and the website to reflect this. Therefore, both the logo and website have been designed to give a clean and efficient feel. Particular emphasis has been given to creating a page that balances both form and function.

        <p>This animation was designed a marketing tool to be used as a pop up banner.</p>
        <p>The idea is that the user then clicks on the banner and is directed to the project page of the website and ideally then goes on to book a consultation. I have animated the character from the logo to show him moving a paintbrush across an empty canvas and painting in and changing the background colour. When the colour changes, the face and body appear, the paintbursh turns into a sword. The heart then begins to beat and the company name appears below. I chose to do this to attract the attention of the user from the pop up. </p>
        <p>I designed the logo for Kingdom Interiors using Adobe Illustrator and each shape in the logo has been given a separate layer. This makes the animation process a lot easier to achieve in Adobe After effects as I can easy apply animation where I want to on the logo.</p>
        <p>Once the animation had been completed. I set the playback duration for 5 seconds and saved the images a GIF file.</p>

        <h1>Mock Ups</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            I decided to make a webpage that could easy be scrolled through for potential clients. I wanted to showcase by best projects and make it easy for clients to contact me directly. The page is designed so a user can scroll through from the initial top Homepage and move through the About Us, Projects, Contact Us pages. I wanted the user to navigate through the webpage like a story. Initially they would see a brief showcase of the companies projects, then read through a brief introduction to the history of the company and then move onto a more focused portfolio of projects, before finally landing on the Contact Us page, which would hopefully lead to a call to action for the user and a booking for the design company. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The background for each section/page is an image of a project that has been completed. This will allow any users who a rushing through the page to still be able to see my best work if they decide to not spend their time going through my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The header was designed to be sticky with the logo remaining in the top left hand corner of the screen. Pages like Blog and Reviews could also easy be found from the header and I added a quick search button to the right hand corner to enable users to find projects or information a lot quicker. The header was deliberately kept symmetrical for wider desktop screens but for mobiles and tablets, this would become a hamburger menu.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The footer is also sticky and I have decided to place the social media links for the brand here as adding them to the header would have made the design seem cluttered. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At each point in the page, I have included buttons that will allow the user to move to through the journey from researching the brand to booking a consultation more efficient.

            I have chosen to use a dark blue colour for the branding and instead of using white for the spaces and backgrounds, I have used a lighter grey as an accent colour. The areas of the website that have text covering an image have been given a medium grey highlight colour with a 30% opacity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the font, I used a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts. For the webpages, links and bulky text, I used Poppins and for the Page headings and any text that felt less informal, I used Cambria Math. Poppins keeps the clean, professional look I wanted to go for and Cambria Math adds a personal touch where I want the users to feel more involved with the brand. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also used a combination of font sizes to emphasis messages and ideas that I wanted the user to both read and experience
        </p>
        <p>
            I have made the page scrollable both vertically and horizontally and by adding navigation buttons alongside images, I have tried to make it as easy as possible for user to move through different projects.

        <h3>Home Page</h3>

        <br>
        <p>The companies motto is displayed across 40% of the screen and scrollable horizontal buttons allow the users to move through the showcased projects from the homepage.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The banner at the top of the page, underneath the header, displays the name of the project and a horizontal gallery at the bottom allows the user to easy scroll through and click on projects that interest them.</p>

        <img src="./Images /Mock Ups/Kingdom Interiors - About Us.png" style="width:1158px;height:642px;">
        <br>
        <p>A brief history and statement of the company is displayed on a translucent box. A “Read More” button has been added as a shortcut for the users to land on the full page. The background image is another project by the company.</p>
